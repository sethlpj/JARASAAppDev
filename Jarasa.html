        The Macintosh Classic is a personal computer sold by Apple Computer from October 15, 1990, to September 14, 1992. 
        The Classic was similar to its predecessors: due to limited technological advances, it had the same 9-inch (23 cm) 
        monochrome CRT display, 512 Ã— 342 pixel resolution, and 4 megabyte (MB) memory limit of older Macintosh computers. 
        Nevertheless, the Classic featured several improvements over the Macintosh Plus, which it replaced as Apple's low-end Mac computer. 
        It was up to 25 percent faster than the Plus and included an Apple SuperDrive 3.5-inch (9 cm) floppy disk drive as standard. 
        Apple released two versions that ranged in price from US$1,000 to $1,500. Reviewers' reactions were mixed; most focused on the slow 
        processor performance and lack of expansion slots. They also noted that the Classic was powerful enough for word processing, spreadsheets, 
        and databases.
